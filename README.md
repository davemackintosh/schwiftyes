I'm learning the Swift lanaguage and I'm also learning about game development concepts because I find data and complex problems fascinating.

I discovered the idea of an ECS while researching game development ideas on Youtube one day and found this brilliant article on how they're structured and built and decided that a port to Swift would be a great way to learn both the language and the problem.

> I don't consider this production ready but at the same time, I am not qualified enough as a Swift engineer to make that decision so that remains to be proven.
